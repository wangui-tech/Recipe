<h1> Pasta Carbonara</h1>
<p>Pasta Carbonara is an Italian pasta dish based on eggs, cheese, bacon and black pepper. It was created in the middle of the 20th century. ... Then, a mixture of eggs, cheese and olive oil is combined with the hot pasta, thereby cooking the eggs. </p>
<h2>Origin </h2>
<p>The whole story of the origin of this dish and its place in cucina romana is vague. The origin of carbonara is much discussed, yet no one really knows. There are several competing theories, but all are anecdotal.
First, although thought of as a typical Roman dish, the name is said to come from a dish made in the Appenine mountains of the Abruzzo by woodcutters who made charcoal for fuel. They would cook the dish over a hardwood charcoal fire and use penne rather than spaghetti because it is easier to toss with the eggs and cheese.
Second, is the obvious one that given the meaning of alla carbonara, coal workerâ€™s style, that the dish was a dish eaten by coal workers or that the abundant use of coarsely ground black pepper resembles coal flakes.
Another story is that food shortages after the liberation of Rome in 1944 were so severe that Allied troops distributed military rations consisting of powdered egg and bacon which the local populace used with water to season the easily stored dried pasta.</p>
